# Noise Reducer

This project reduces noise from audio files using Python.

I also really like to use poetry for dependancy management, if you're also a fellow poet use the: 

    poetry install

## Files

- **`main.py`**: Script that reduces noise from `mywav.WAV`.
- **`mywav.WAV`**: Your original audio file.
- **`mywav_reduced_noise.wav`**: Output audio with reduced noise.

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install librosa numpy soundfile
2. Run the script:
    ```bash 
    pythom main.py
3. check the mywav_reduced_noise.wav file for the noise-reduced audio.
